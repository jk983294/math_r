## F test
F test compare the variances of two normally distributed groups,
determine whether the variances are equal. there is no limitation on sample size.

## z test
used to validate a hypothesis that the samples belongs to the same population

A z-test is used when the population parameters (mean and standard deviation) are known.

* Null: Sample mean is same as the population mean
* Alternate: Sample mean is not same as the population mean

## t test
used to compare the mean of two given samples.

A t-test is used when the population parameters (mean and standard deviation) are not known.

* Null: Sample means are the same
* Alternate: Sample means is not the same

## One-way ANOVA
* Null: All pairs of samples are same i.e. all sample means are equal
* Alternate: At least one pair of samples is significantly different

## Chi-square test
it can use for continuous variables

1. a goodness of fit, comparing frequencies of one attribute variable to theoretical expectations.
2. a test of independence, comparing if a variable is associate with another variable.

## p value interpretation
* t-test, if p<0.05, we reject the null hypothesis(m1=m2), which means mean(x1) not equal to mean(x2)
* f-test, if p<0.05, we reject the null hypothesis(var1=var2), which means variance(x1) not equal to variance(x2)
* chi-square test, if p<0.05, we reject the null hypothesis(x1 independent from x2), which means two variables are dependent
