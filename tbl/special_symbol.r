# .SD, It stands for Subset of Data, It by itself is a data.table that holds the data for the current group defined using by.
# .SD contains all the columns except the grouping columns by default.
# .SDcols specify columns in .SD, like .SDcols = c("x", "y") or .SDcols = x:y or .SDcols = !(x:y) or .SDcols = patterns('team')
# .BY is a special symbol that holds the value of by
# .N is an integer containing the number of rows in the group.
# .I is an integer vector equal to seq_len(nrow(x))
# .GRP is an integer containing a simple group counter
# .NGRP is an integer containing the number of groups
